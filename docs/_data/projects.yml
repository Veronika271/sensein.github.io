- title: Voice and language biomarkers of health
  image: ../images/review_figure3_heatmap.jpeg
  description: >
    The goal of this project is to observe and analyze speech variations in 
    across disorders by analyzing different types of data including ecological 
    momentary assessments, recordings of clinical interviews, and social media posts.
    Key questions we hope to answer are: 1) Is speech a good longitudinal biomarker? 
    2) How much speech information is needed for stable tracking? 3) Can linguistic 
    information augment voice models?

  image: ../images/Mumble_Melody_logo.jpg
  description: >
    The aim of this project is to explore assistive technologies to help increase fluency for people who stutter. Our studies investigate the use of Altered Auditory Feedback (AAF), a stuttering intervention in which an individualâ€™s speech is played back to them in an altered manner. Below are further details about this project as well as a page about our study.
